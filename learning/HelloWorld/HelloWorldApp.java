// So we would like to dissect the program


class HelloWorldApp {

	// main method, with the (exact?) givem
	// signature. 
	// So the principle is the same here
	// is that it will be accepting a array 
	// with elements of type String.
	// I guess that the [] indicates that it is an
	// array we are accepting. 
	// It is in this way that we can pass arguments from the
	// outside.
